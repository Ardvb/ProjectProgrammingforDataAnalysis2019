## Getting started

Follow these steps to download this repository:

- Go to my repository on Github: https://github.com/Ardvb/ProjectProgrammingforDataAnalysis2019
- Click the clone or download button.
- Save the repository to your device.
- To run the program open a command interface and navigate to the folder in which the repository was saved.

## Jupyter Notebook

I used a Jupyter notebook to display my work. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. https://jupyter.org/

## Running my Jupiter Notebook

- Install Jupyterlab. This is part of the Anaconda package, that can be downloaded here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
- Navigate to the folder where the repository has been downloaded on the command line.
- type: Jupyter Notebook
- From the 'home' page, click on the file called "Project2019.ipynb"
- For more information on how to use Jupyter Notebook go to the Help section in the toolbar on the top of your screen.

### This repository contains my solution to below problem statement

### Problem statement
For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.
Specifically, in this project you should:
- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set.

### Variables used:
- Life expectancy
- Birth weight
- Birth province
- IQ
- Height
